Solar cells are developed for maximum efficiency at standard conditions.  Installation sites and applications generally use these cells and standardised geometries in assumption that they will provide the best results in all cases.  However, it is possible that different cells, or combination of cells, in slightly different environments will perform better, especially when applications make demands other than the highest instantaneous efficiency, or highest yearly power generation.  We utilize a [description of model] to co-optimise solar cells, solar cell mixes, and their opperating environments for both UAVs and terrestrial systems. We present optimal solar cells mixes and installations for [3] locations, [2] load profiles, and various relative emphasis on overall power generation vs. load matching, for both currently available and all possible solar cells.  The lattitude, altitude, weather patterns, and local load profiles all affect the optimal solar cell and system mix, and modest improvements over the current standard are seen with commercially available panels, with additonal improvements available when all possible combinations are considered. This process is fast and simple for the optimisation even individual residential solar installations. In solar cells used on UAVs, accurate description of the cells' performance as a function of altitude enables the co-optimisation of vehicle flight altitude [other parameters] and the solar cell itself for improved UAV performance. (Something about the impact of this on the application of solar-powered UAVs, or the market for solar cells for UAVs)
