add air mass into spect
actual fill factor info (22% AM1.5G cell)


questions to investigate first:

test against single junction optimisation

the airplane - need spectra constraints (air mass, altitude) - get Si cell efficiency(air mass, altitude)
get it to deal w/ twilight appropriately
1) reproduce other paper with right solar model
2) multijunction
3) vertical surfaces, cloud reflective panels, other additional things

solar field
polyculture & tilt optimisation
given currently existing plants around the world and their local power utilisation
-varying lattitude (arctic, temperate, tropical, equatorial?) and at least one high altitude
-what is best for each plant
-what is best for all plants together
-in terms of efficiency then considering daily loads
-daily pricing of electricity

good metric: minimise max difference between demand and generation


What I've done since leaving boston:
- implemented fit to short wavelength total as a function of height only
- extended to 20km

Todo:
- check if latitude is making a difference
- batch solar spectrum generation at Air Masses
- three-dimensional fitting with AM,wl,height (2d in short wavelengths?)
- somehow test that compound constraint can be used by gpkit
